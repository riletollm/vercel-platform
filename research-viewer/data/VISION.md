# Learning Experience Platform — Product Vision

## Core Thesis

**The disruption isn't becoming a better LMS. It's making the concept of an LMS obsolete because learning management implies learning is something you manage. Real learning is something you do in flow, and you track it as a side effect.**

Current LMS: Broadcast model. Content sits in the system. Learner is passive consumer. Compliance first, learning second.

Our Model: Conversational, dialog-driven, format-native learning. Learner is in flow. Evidence builds invisibly. Learning first, compliance as byproduct.

## The Problem We're Solving

**For Learners:**
- LMS feels like punishment ("ugh, I have to do my mandatory training today")
- Content is stale, boring, formatted for 2010s (long videos, walls of text)
- Desktop-first in a mobile-native world
- No agency — path is fixed, pace is fixed
- No social proof or community
- Feedback loops are slow or non-existent

**For Institutions (Colleges, Employers, Training Providers):**
- Low engagement, high dropout
- Compliance records don't show actual learning
- Content is expensive to update (refreshed every 2-3 years)
- No adaptability to learner needs or market changes
- EPA/assessment integration is manual and painful
- No portability (learner data is trapped in LMS)

**For Assessors (EPAOs):**
- Evidence collection is fragmented and self-reported
- Hard to distinguish genuine mastery from checkbox completion
- Assessment plans don't align well with actual competency
- No visibility into learner development until end

## The Solution (High-Level)

A **conversational learning experience platform** that feels like entertainment but builds standards-aligned competency records.

Three integrated layers:

### 1. The App (TikTok-like Feed)
- Mobile-first PWA
- Daily personalized feed of 60-90 second micro-videos
- Algorithm surfaces "what you need next" based on role, level, gaps
- Streaks, mastery %, progress visible
- Feels like scrolling, not studying

### 2. The Learning PA (WhatsApp Coach)
- Personal AI coach on WhatsApp
- Daily nudges ("You're on a 7-day streak, let's keep it going")
- Proactive reminders ("You learned X 2 weeks ago, time to refresh")
- Question answering (learner asks → PA explains + surfaces video)
- Motivation and milestone celebration
- Assessment prep ("Ready for EPA? Here's where you stand")

### 3. The Silent Backend (Competency Engine)
- Maps all content to KSBs (for apprenticeships) and standards
- Tracks mastery development across learner journey
- Spaced repetition algorithm (when to resurface content)
- Evidence builder (auto-generates audit trail)
- Knows when learner is ready for formal assessment

## Why This Wins

1. **Format-native** — Matches how people actually consume content in 2026 (Reels, Shorts, TikTok)
2. **Frictionless** — No "I have to sit down and do training." Just scroll when you have time.
3. **Habit-forming** — Streaks, daily nudges, spaced repetition (borrowed from Duolingo, proven to work)
4. **Personal** — WhatsApp PA feels like coaching, not broadcast
5. **Invisible compliance** — Evidence builds as side effect of learning
6. **Standards-aligned** — Content maps to KSBs, EPAs, occupational standards from day 1
7. **Scalable content** — AI generates micro-videos from source material (cheap, fast, refreshable)
8. **Portable** — Learner records follow them, not trapped in LMS
9. **Multi-vertical** — Same engine works for apprenticeships, corporate training, colleges, healthcare

## POC Target: SSEN Cable Jointer (ST1332)

**Partner:** Scottish and Southern Electric Networks (SSEN)  
**Standard:** ST1332 Power industry distribution cable jointer  
**Problem:** Need to accelerate jointer training to support ED2 delivery; current bottleneck is time-to-competency and mentor availability

### Why SSEN Jointer

- **Real partner with real urgency** — SSEN has documented workforce gap for ED2 delivery
- **Clear, acute pain point** — Time-to-competency is 12-18 months; SSEN needs to scale to 9-12 months
- **Safety-critical domain** — Cable jointing has high-risk hazards (flashover, electrocution); research shows VR improves hazard recognition by 300%
- **Well-defined competency framework** — ST1332 has clear KSBs and progression pathway
- **Measurable success criteria** — Time-to-competency, mentor efficiency, EPA pass rates, safety incidents
- **Real learner cohorts** — SSEN has 10-15 learners per cycle; not a hypothetical audience
- **Commercial signal** — If successful, this becomes a case study + paying customer from day 1

### The Jointer Training Problem

Current SSEN flow:
1. Classroom training at Thatcham (foundational knowledge)
2. Live-work experience (constrained by mentor availability, network opportunities)
3. Portfolio evidence gathering (manual, slow)
4. EPA assessment (independent assessor)

Constraints:
- Limited physical training capacity at Thatcham
- Limited experienced jointers available for mentoring (they're the scarce resource)
- Limited live-network opportunities for safe, progressive exposure
- Low-frequency, high-risk scenarios hard to prepare trainees for
- Manual portfolio tracking delays competency visibility

### Why This Matters for the Platform

Jointer training is the *perfect* proving ground because:
- High stakes (safety) = motivation is genuine (not checkbox compliance)
- Clear progression path (knowledge → scenario prep → live work → independence)
- Specific, repeatable scenarios (cable faults, hazard recognition, decision-making under pressure)
- Real mentor involvement (platform enhances mentor effectiveness, doesn't replace)
- Measurable business outcomes (time, safety, cost)

## What Success Looks Like (Year 1)

- 1 training provider or college piloting with 100-200 learners
- 60%+ weekly engagement (vs. 20-30% for traditional LMS)
- EPA pass rate improvement (if applicable)
- 80%+ completion of assigned learning paths
- Learners report higher satisfaction (NPS >40)
- 20%+ faster time-to-competency vs. traditional model
- Evidence audit trail auto-generated with zero manual work

---

## Non-Goals (What We're NOT Building)

- Another LMS (we're replacing the concept, not copying it)
- Instructor-led training platform (different problem)
- A social network (social proof is light touch, not central)
- Global leaderboards or competitive elements (we're optimizing for learning, not gaming)
- A certification body (we're preparing learners for external assessment, not awarding ourselves)

---

## Commercial Model (Later)

- B2B SaaS for training providers, colleges, employers
- Per-learner-per-month subscription
- Higher tier: custom content generation, integrations, dedicated support
- Premium: EPA integration, portfolio building, assessor tools

But first: Prove the learning model works. Revenue follows product-market fit.
