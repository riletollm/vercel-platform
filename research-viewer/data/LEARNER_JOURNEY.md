# Learner Journey Map — SSEN Cable Jointer

## Pre-Start: Briefing

**Setting:** SSEN jointer apprentice, Day 0 (before classroom training begins)

- **Email from SSEN Training:** "Welcome to jointer apprenticeship! Your learning coach will be on WhatsApp. This helps you prepare for live work safely."
- Learner receives WhatsApp message: "Hi! I'm your learning coach. Before you hit the network, we'll get you ready. Start with cable identification — 2 min, then chat?"

## Day 1-7: Foundation Week (Classroom → Digital Bridge)

### Monday (First Day of Classroom)
- Learner opens app after classroom session on cable identification
- PA nudge: "Your trainer covered cable types today. Quick 90-sec recap?"
- Learner watches micro-video: "How to spot copper, XLPE, and paper-insulated cable"
- Quick check: "What's the risk with older paper insulation?" (learner picks answer)
- **Result:** Streak day 1. Mastery on "Cable ID" moves from 0% → 15%

### Tuesday
- PA: "Live cables are live cables. Here's why this matters. 90 sec?"
- Video: "Electrical hazard recognition: the top 3 things that kill jointers"
- Question: Interactive scenario — "You see a cable with no marking. What do you do?"
- Learner's answer logged (even if wrong, PA explains right approach)

### Wednesday
- Classroom: LOTO (Lockout/Tagout) procedure training
- PA evening nudge: "You learned LOTO today. Let's make sure it sticks. 2 min?"
- Video: "LOTO step-by-step: never skip step 3"
- Practice check: "Name the 5 steps in order" (fill in blanks)

### Thursday-Friday
- Spaced review kicks in
- PA: "You got cable ID right 2 days ago. Refresh before you forget? 60 sec?"

## Week 2-3: Scenario Prep Phase

### Week 2 (Classroom continues + Network Familiarisation)
- Classroom: Fault-finding workflows, decision-making under pressure
- Daily PA nudge: "Today's focus: [fault type scenario]. When's best for you?"
- Monday: "Cable fault decision tree — 2 min intro"
- Wednesday: "What would YOU do? Scenario: buried cable, power still on. Choose your move"
- Friday: "Hazard recognition challenge — spot the 3 dangers in this joint. You got 2, here's the 3rd"

### Week 3 (Live-Work Prep Begins)
- Learner starts supervised on-site observation (no live work yet)
- Classroom ending; transition to mentored experience
- PA shifts focus: "You're about to see this IRL. Here's what to expect. Your mentor is [name]."
- Video: "First day on-site safety rules: the stuff that could go wrong"

## Week 4-8: Live Work Phase (Supervised)

### Week 4-5 (Supervised Live Jointing Begins)
- Mentor: "Today you're assisting on a cable repair. Watch everything."
- PA pre-nudge: "Day before first live work. Here's what to watch for."
- Video: "Real-world cable joint — what does it actually look like?"
- On-site: Learner assists mentor, mentor gives feedback
- Post-work PA nudge: "How'd it go? What surprised you?"
- Learner replies; PA captures sentiment (struggling vs. confident)
- PA auto-surfaces: "You hesitated on cable identification. Here's fresh footage of that scenario"

### Week 6-8 (Progressive Responsibility)
- Mentor supervision decreases gradually (learner doing more)
- PA detects: "Your last 3 cable IDs were flawless. You're ready for the next challenge"
- New content unlocks: "Fault-finding under pressure — when the customer is watching"

- **Week 1:** "Oh, I'm actually remembering this stuff. And I'm proud of my streak."
- **Week 3:** "I feel ready to go on-site. Less nervous because I know the theory."
- **Week 5:** "First live joint went well. My mentor said I was more prepared than usual."
- **Week 8:** "I got fault-finding now. That's a big one."
- **Week 12:** "I'm ready for EPA. I know I'm ready."
- **EPA Day:** "I've got this. I did the work. I earned this."
- **Post-EPA:** "I'm an independent jointer. 4 weeks faster than the old way."

That's the outcome we're building for.

## The SSEN Case Study Metric

**Baseline (Traditional Training):**
- Time to independent LV readiness: 12-18 weeks
- Mentor hours per trainee: 120+ hours
- EPA pass rate: 85%
- Safety incidents during training: 1-2 per cohort

**With This Platform (POC Target):**
- Time to independent LV readiness: **9-12 weeks** (30% faster)
- Mentor hours per trainee: **80-90 hours** (25% more efficient)
- EPA pass rate: **90%+** (better preparation)
- Safety incidents: **0** (better hazard recognition)

If we hit these numbers in the POC, SSEN scales immediately. That's the win.
